Lumberyard is iSAX indexing stored in HBase for persistent and scalable index storage.

Lumberyard is based on the paper: http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/iSAX.pdf

The jmotif project provides some support classes for Lumberyard: http://code.google.com/p/jmotif/

Lumberyard is licensed ASF 2.0



State of Code

- approximate search works

- kNN and exact search are currently broken for iSAX indexes in jmotif's implementation. Therefore Lumberyard does not currently have them, either.

- Indexing only works as a serial process currently. I've yet to dig into the best way to update multiple columns at once in hbase.



Notes

- rebuilt to use the hadoop-core (20.2) and hbase (0.90) jars from CDH3u0
